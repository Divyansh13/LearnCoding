# LearnCoding
Hello, I had decided to start a project where the team has to share their coding skills. 
My vision in creating this open source project is to create practical tutorials and examples from real life learning to
teach newbies coding skills. There are two ways paradigms allow into this project: C for procedural programming and 
C++/Java for OOP programming. Other than that Python is also included. 
But major focus is not on language rather on programming basics.
